I have a repository with a file Hello.java. When I compile it an additional Hello.class file is generated.
I created an entry for Hello.class in a .gitignore file. However the file still appears to be tracked.
I want to know how to make git ignore Hello.class.
The problem is that .gitignore ignores just files that weren't tracked before (by git add). Run git rm --cached name_of_file and your file will be ignored again (in case it's mentioned in .gitignore).

	git rm --cached name_of_file  #删除缓存中已经追踪的文件, .gitignore 就会生效
